Chess350
========

Chess Project for CIS 350



INSTRUCTIONS
-------------
In Eclipse, select File -> Import

Select Git -> Projects from Git

Select Clone URI

Paste https://github.com/JacobHunsberger/Chess350/ into URI, Host and Repository path will autofill. Enter your GitHub username and password.

You'll then create a clone of the repository on your own computer.

The rest is straight forward, email me if you have questions or something doesn't work.

A shared project looks like a regular project but with orange cylinders on the icons.



USING GIT
---------
I don't know a lot about Git yet, but I figured out some of the basics.

You need to commit all your changes and then push or publish your local repository.  If you right click a shared project and go to Team, there is a whole menu of options for Git available.  Click commit, check the files you want to update, then click "commit and push".

There's also a Git perspective that lets you look at everything in more detail.

Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> Git Repository Exploring

If you know more about Git, please add to this or make changes.  I know there are some things like checkouts that will come up when we're all trying to work on the project at the same time.
